# AI Smart Document Search using Endee

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a beginner-friendly AI project built for campus placement.  
The project demonstrates how a vector database (Endee) can be used to store and search text using embeddings.

## 🧠 What the System Does
1. Converts text documents into numerical representations (embeddings).
2. These embeddings can be stored in a vector database like Endee.
3. The system allows searching using natural language queries.

## 📂 Files in this Project
- **ingest.py** → Converts documents into embeddings.
- **search.py** → Simulates searching using a user query.
- **requirements.txt** → Lists required Python packages.

## 🚀 How to Run (Locally)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ingest.py
python search.py
